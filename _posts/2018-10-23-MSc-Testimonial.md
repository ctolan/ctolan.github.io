 I got an email last week seeing a testimonial on the impact the DevOps MSc has had on me. It was an opportunity to reflect so I took it. It is an interesting question of the chicken or the egg. Was it learning the material for the MSc that spurred me to the fore at work, or was it my need to be at the fore in work that made my desire to understand DevOps so visceral?

Either way here I am in semester two finding it quite easy, the modules are not too complex in part because I cracked the back on the theory and literature in semester one and over the summer. Now we are getting down to the nitty gritty of change management and the implementation of pipelines, it is fun stuff. It is also a case of having experience of being back in college again already, so it is coming easier. First MSc I just wanted to pass, this one I want a first. Since I’ve done one already I know what I’m facing and it’s easier to take. That’s the problem of experience you have to do it to get it.

Anyway, I submitted my testimonial blurb so we’ll see what comes of it. I asked my classmates they were all asked too, I am not their favourite :-(
