Back in work today and gradually getting over the post holiday shock. I have to say it really hit home when I sat on the freezing cold toilet seat at 4am. What is this the stone ages, why are they not heated like in Japan? I might just have to start a side gig importing them to set right what is wrong with this situation.

Good news, my testimonial made it into the brochure for [the DevOps MSc](https://www.ictskillnet.ie/training/new-msc-devops-online/), expand the "What are past participants saying" section and it's right there. This might be a longshot but if anyone is considering taking the course and wants to know more, feel free to reach out to me. I'd be more than happy to honestly discuss the content of the course with you. I think a few students where surprised by the course content first semister. We spent a lot of time on theory, where they were expecting tools. This semister has been much more hands on and it is equally tough to please everyone, I'm sure they're been complaints that it wasn't with the tools that they know or use.

Anyway - I better get back to my projects I feel I have some ground to cover after being away for two weeks.

Thanks for reading.
