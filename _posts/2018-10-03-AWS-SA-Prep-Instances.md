Back at my [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/) prep reviewing the Whizlab practice exams.

I am still reviewing my first completed AWS practice exam. It had been so long since my last attempt that I forgot what Question i have reviewed up til. So I started over again. It is revision so it won't hurt.

I took some time to look at [the EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). There are five categories and I want at least a passing familarity with each family should there be a questions about suitable instance types on the exam.

- General Purpose = T and M
    - Burstable
    - Unlimited or Predictable
    - Nitro - offload Netowrk and Storage to hardware
- Compute Optimized = C
    - HPC
    - Compute Optimised
    - Burstable
    - Cluster Networking
    - MMO Games
    - Video Encoding
- Memory Optimized Z, X and R
    - Up to 768GB Mem
    - Web scale Mem cache
    - High perf DB's
    - In Memory DB.
- Accelerated Computing P, G and F
    - General Purpose GPU
    - Machine learning
    - HPC
    - Finance
    - Fluid Dynamics
    - Speach Recognition
    - G = Graphics Optimized
    - F = FPGA's
- Storage Optimized H. I and D
    - H 16TB high through put.
    - I High Random I/O
    - D for Disk 48TB

That a quick run through of the different types. I've not seen any questions yet on the different types but this can't hurt to understand.
