As I mentioned in my initial post on this topic (eek nearly two months ago), for college we were asked to create a Chaos Monkey like script to test out HA implementation. This was a really fun assignment and I got to work with AWS PowerShell Lambdas too so win win. I developed a python script that used the Boto3 module to connect to and work with AWS.
