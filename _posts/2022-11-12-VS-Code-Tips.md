Quick post - this page might become a page of tips.

In VS Code configure a shortcut to "Run Selected Text" in the active terminal. 

![Tip Files 1]({{ site.url }}/images/VScode-Tip-1.png)

It is not configured by default and it is a top tip, I use it all the time. Specifically just now I was able to highlight my saved Docker run command in my permanent scratch file and run it. No thinking about what parameters I need or which mount points that are required.

I'll leave this at this for now and get back to the main post.

Thanks for reading.
