This is the first post in my blog, so let me introduce myself. My name is Connor and I got my first computer when I was 11 or 12 and have never been far from one since.

I have worked in IT for over 13 years. In that time, I've done a lot. I am starting this blog because i want to document what I am learning so that you might find it useful, or so that I can refer back to it in the future.

My focus has been in virtualisation infrastructure specifically the VMware suite of virtualisation software. I am currently upskilling in AWS and plan to work through the material for the AWS Solution Architect exams on this blog. I will work through the exam blueprint setting up sample architectures and experimenting with what i think are the interesting combinations of infrastructure and services provided by AWS. I will share out my sample configurations via my GitHub linked below.

I hope to relate my experience of infrastructure at real scale to you the reader so that you can bridge the gap from AWS introductions to real world deployments and problems. I would love to hear from you if you have dealt with similar issues and found a better way to resolve it.

That is all for today, thanks for reading. Conor.
