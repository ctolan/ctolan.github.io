Who am I? What am I? What do I do? Does it matter? Last autumn a colleague and I were asked to do some research around job titles, we knew that our day to day work had changed significantly and we no longer considered ourselves classic system administrators but if this is true, what were we? Interesting titles like DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and Infrastructure Developer were thrown into the mix and we set off to investigate desirability and suitability for a title change.

I’m writing this to help you understand how you can navigate all the new job categories that keep popping up in our industry. To see question if there is a point in changing jobs if you merely end up doing the same work with a different name. Some job titles I felt were aspirational and others felt like they were marketed to attract applicants, and others were clear copy and paste from other roles out there. It was an interesting bit of research.

First thing we did was review jobs advertised with these new titles on a few well-known sites. The objective level set with the market and to collect the job descriptions that were out there. There were very different types of roles that were labelled DevOps and SRE. You really do need to drill down into the specification to get a feel for what they are looking for. Some SRE roles were clearly looking for a System Administrator, the job specs were identical to Unix Admin or Network Admin roles from a few years ago. And some DevOps roles seems to be Build Engineer roles, or heavily focused on the pipeline rather than the application going through it.

I also educated myself by reading what [industry commentators](https://medium.com/metrosystemsro/a-study-towards-understanding-the-job-titles-in-a-devops-world-fad544604ff) were saying about these new roles and the changes in IT. Specifically I kept hearing the DevOps was not a role and so [DevOps teams should not](https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/) exist. That DevOps was a movement, a culture and you can’t …. you’ve heard it before.

Another factor I had not initially considered was the view of the Talent team, they need to be able to advertise for future roles with the team. They also have a benchmarking/relative payscale consideration.

We opened it up for discussion internally and voted a couple of times I believe.

Thanks for reading.
