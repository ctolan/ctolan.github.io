I'm writing this update on my phone from the airport, the beauty of GitHub is that it is available everywhere. To post or edit now I don't need to be at my computer.

 Since this is all code, all I needed to do was log into GitHub create a new file and start writing. One hesitation of many I had starting this blog was that I wouldn't keep it updated and that would reflect badly on me.
 but with the availability of GitHub I'll have no excuses.
 while on the topic I may as well cover mug other reservations.
 
 I didn't think anyone would care, I'm well aware of the pointless update posts that go out on Facebook and Twitter, who cares?
 
 to be continued.
