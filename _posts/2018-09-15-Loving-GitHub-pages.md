I'm writing this update on my phone at the airport, the beauty of GitHub is that it is available everywhere. To post or edit now I don't need to be at my computer.

Since this is all code, all I needed to do was log into GitHub create a new file and start writing. One hesitation of many I had with starting a blog was that I wouldn't keep it updated and that would reflect badly on me, but with the availability of GitHub I'll have no excuses.

Ok lets get down to some automation content. Over however many posts it takes I want to do a deeper dive on how I can controll things within my house by voice. I can turn on/off a few lights, turn on/off the TV and of course <a href="https://conortolan.com/Blinds-Ups!/">open and close the blinds</a>. 

I consider my setup DIY, the bits and pieces I've hobbled together are not kits. The central platform that really brings it all together is an opensource project called <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a>, a friend of mine <a href="https://github.com/ryanm101">Ryan</a> introduced me to it. It runs on a RaspberryPi and they've created a custom image that I flashed onto an SD card.
