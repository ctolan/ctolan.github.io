All done now, well mostly. Friday we presented our final assessment in the last day of the semester. I had an additional presentation to complete because I missed the last on campus day with being in Japan. They all went well and now I can focus on getting some of what I learned down on this blog. I’ve a backlog of ideas I need to work through. Great problem to have. As I said I’m mostly finished I still need to complete a state of the art type research paper and right now I’ve no idea what topic to look into. Hanging in the back of my mind is that I need to start working towards my thesis project/research but I’ve no strong idea for that yet either…
