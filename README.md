# My Personal Blog

## This is the repository for my personal blog.
I love that my blog is code, I work day to day with Infrastructure as code and it feels natural to publish my blog with the same sort of tools. I get to write in VS Code and publish with a git push - its awesome.

## To Do
Create an RSS feed.
Do a road map for the posts on this blog.
Start my AWS study blogs.
Write my postmortum on passing the AWS Solutions Arcitech Associate exam.
